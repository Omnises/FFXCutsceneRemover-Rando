# FFXSpeedrunMod
A program for implementing one or many of several game modifications for speedrunning the Windows Steam version of Final Fantasy X HD Remaster.
If you encounter any bugs or have any questions, please open an issue on GitHub or contact us on the [FFX Speedrun Discord](https://discord.gg/X3qXHWG).

### Important

* This mod is designed and tested to be used for speedruns only. Using this mod for normal playthroughs is not supported, and the unexpected behaviour may cause game-breaking bugs. If you use this mod for normal playthroughs, it is strongly recommended to manually save regularly and not rely on auto-saves.

* This mod currently only works on Windows using the Steam release of FFX.

### Usage:

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page here](https://github.com/erickt420/FFXCutsceneRemover/releases).

2. Launch FFXSpeedrunMod.exe.

3. Type "Y" / "N" and press Enter to Enable / Disable each of the setup options.

4. Launch Final Fantasy X.

The order in which you launch the mod and the game does not matter.
You do not need to start a new game in order to gain the effects of the mod, however, if you start from a save file you may find that it takes a while before the cutscenes start skipping.

### True RNG:

The True RNG setting is used to make RNG manipulation impossible.
For speedruns, it is required to use this setting to submit to the True RNG category.
For normal gameplay, using this setting will make no perceivable difference.

### True RNG:

The Set Seed setting used to make RNG manipulation impossible.
For speedruns, you can use this setting to submit to the PC Any% or CSR Any% category.
You must input one of the 256 naturally obtainable seeds available on PC. Details of the possible seed IDs can be found at https://grayfox96.github.io/FFX-Info/rng/hd-seeds
